<h1 align="center">Onerocket-Chatpad</h1>

Fork of [chatpad](https://github.com/deiucanta/chatpad) with newly built features to support the Onerocket.ai API. 

Onerocket is an AI broker/aggregator designed to provide a single path to many LLMs and AI systems. Additionally, it also provides simple one request endpoints to execute more complicated logic.
